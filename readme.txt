This plugin allows you to place the output of pandora's (http://pandora.com) rss-feeds freely anywhere in your wordpress-theme.

== Description ==

Inspired by and building upon the great work of Jean-Paul Franssen, who developed a wordpress-sidebar-widget to display feeds coming from Pandora, I have now finished programming a WordPress plugin, which can help you to place Pandora-feeds freely anywhere in your theme-templates.

For more information on Pandora, visit http://pandora.com.

1. Upload the file pandorafeeds.php to your plugin-directory: www.yourblog.com/wp-content/plugins/
1. Go to the plugin-section of your blog's admin-area, scroll down to 'Pandora Feeds for Wordpress Plugin' and press 'activate'.
1. Now go to the Options section and klick on 'Pandora Feeds'
1. Type into the input-field your Pandora-account name. You register at Pandora with your E-Mail-address. Your account-name is the local-part of the address. For example, if you have registered with john.doe@example.com, you should enter john.doe into the textfield.
